Not "bee bee blackjack" but "buh-buh-blackjack"...

It's Blackjack using Backbone.js and Bootstrap, along with other neat tools I mention at the bottom. Hope you enjoy playing it!

Afterthoughts
--------
I had a lot of fun writing this. Picked up some nifty tools for the first time and enjoyed fiddling with the UI to make it more playable. I also learned that I didn't know much about the actual rules of Blackjack before besides trying not to go over 21. Now I want to try my luck in Vegas. :)

**Future things**

*   Sounds
*   Shuffle animation
*   High scores/averages/crazy stats
*   Have the chips accumulate on the table over time (assuming you're up and not down). I think this would feel more gratifying and more real-world like.
